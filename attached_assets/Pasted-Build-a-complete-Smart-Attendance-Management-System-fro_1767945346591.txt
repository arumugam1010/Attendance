Build a complete Smart Attendance Management System frontend only for a Construction Builder Company using React by converting an existing HTML, CSS, JavaScript student attendance project into a modern React application. The core attendance workflow and logic must remain the same, but all student-related terminology must be replaced with construction employee terminology. Use React Functional Components with Hooks (useState, useEffect), React Router for page navigation, and Axios for API integration (assume backend APIs already exist, do not implement backend logic). The application must be fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices used at construction sites. Implement two user roles in the UI: Admin and Employee. The Admin interface should include login, employee management screens to add, edit, delete, and view employees with fields such as Employee ID, Name, Role or Designation, Mobile Number, Site Location, and Status (Active or Inactive), as well as attendance report pages with filters for date and employee, displaying employee photo, date, time, and a Google Maps link generated from latitude and longitude. The Employee interface should include login, a dashboard, attendance marking screen, and attendance history view. The attendance marking component must automatically request camera permission using the HTML5 Camera API, request location permission using the Browser Geolocation API, display a live camera preview, capture a live photo on button click, automatically fetch current GPS latitude and longitude, automatically capture the current date and time, and prevent any manual input for photo, location, date, or time. The captured photo, location coordinates, date, time, and employee ID must be prepared and sent to the backend using Axios. Generate reusable React components such as Login, Dashboard, EmployeeList, EmployeeForm, AttendanceMark, AttendanceHistory, AttendanceReport, ProtectedRoute, and API service files. Use clean component structure, proper state management, basic form validation, and user-friendly UI messages for permission errors (camera or location denied). Provide a proper frontend folder structure, complete React components, routing setup, Axios service configuration, and clear instructions to run the React application.
